<h2>North Italy and Slovenia</h2>
Enjoyed the perfect Italian retreat in Lake Como region. Spent a few hours at Lake Garda before spending couple days in Verona. Wandered in the Ljubjlana's historic downtown, strolled in the coastal town of Piran and explored the Triglav National Park in Slovenia. Hopped on and off the Venice ferries and spent a day in Milan.
